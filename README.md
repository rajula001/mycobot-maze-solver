# 🤖 MyCobot Pro 600 — Maze Solver to Robot Execution (A* → IK → TCP)

This project solves a maze from a camera snapshot, maps the pixel path to robot coordinates, computes joint angles for a **MyCobot Pro 600**, and streams those angles to the arm over **TCP**.  
It demonstrates the full pipeline: **perception → planning → kinematics → actuation**.
